# Day 7: Loops (for, while)

## ðŸ“˜ Concept
In Python:
- **for loop**: Used when you know how many times to repeat. Iterates over a sequence (list, string, range).
- **while loop**: Runs until a condition becomes false.
- Both loops can use:
  - **break** â†’ exits the loop completely
  - **continue** â†’ skips the current iteration and goes to the next one

## ðŸŸ¢ Easy Challenge: Print Numbers
- Write a program that prints numbers from **1 to 10** using a `for` loop.
- Do the same using a `while` loop.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Challenge: Sum of Digits
- Ask the user to enter a number.
- Use a `while` loop to calculate the **sum of its digits**.  
  Example: `123 â†’ 1+2+3 = 6`

## ðŸ”´ Hard Challenge: Multiplication Table
- Ask the user for a number.
- Print its **multiplication table (1 to 10)** using a `for` loop.  
  Example: For input `5`, output:  
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50
